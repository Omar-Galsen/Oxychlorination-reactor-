# Oxychlorination-reactor-
This MATLAB code models an oxychlorination reactor, solving ODEs for species flowrates, temperature, and pressure. The main script sets up initial conditions, calls ode45 to solve the ODEs, and plots results. The ODE function defines mass balances, reaction kinetics, heat transfer, and pressure drop using Arrhenius equations and ideal gas laws. ðŸš€
